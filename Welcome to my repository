Hello all, I am super excited about sharing my learning experience with anyone interested in looking at this repository. 
My goal is to offer a resource that anyone, no matter what their experience level may be, can use. 
That is why I want this repository to contain nothing short of simple, well-commented, and easy to understand code. 
As my programs become more advance I will also dedicate time to making write-ups on my programs when I feel that comments are insufficient. 
Thanks for checking out my repository!
